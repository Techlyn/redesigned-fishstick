I went way over my time window big time.

I couldn't bring myself to complete this task in two hours.
After 2 hours passed I wanted to completed more of this little project.

The problem was - I encountered an error that I made that took me an hour to fix, only to realise the solution was super simple.

I was too invested in this one and that was not the point of this challenge. But alas I completed it after spending what seems to be like 3 - 4 hours on it - including the hour finding the problem.


Okay so this one was simple you move a circle around and collect coins when you collect all 10 a message popup says you win.

I learnt LOADS making this.

    * How to move the player around by giving it movement keys.
    * How to setup collision so character doesn't fall off screen.
    * How to generate coins from one coin - without having to make 10 and place them in the world.
    * How to make a score counter.
    * How to make a win condition.
    * How to reset the game.
    And perhaps learnt loads more.


The issue I faced was when I was making the character movable.

I used Vectors to setup the movement.

{% highlight csharp %}

using System;
using System.Xml.Schema;
using NUnit.Framework.Internal;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.InputSystem;

public class mover : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] InputAction direction;
    [SerializeField] float speed = 10.0f;


    Vector2 movement;

    void OnEnable()
    {
        direction.Enable();
    }

    void Update()
    {
        ProcessMovement();

    }

    private void ProcessMovement()
    {
        movement = direction.ReadValue<Vector2>() * speed * Time.deltaTime;
        transform.Translate(movement);
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}


There isn't a lot to make the movement. But it took me a while to figure this out which is crazy. Unity has a fantastic button input system. Makes things so much easier to setup.

I wanted to try and make it using vectors only, because you could easily do something like this:


{% highlight csharp %}

float move;
float speed = 10.0f;


if (keyboard.current.wkey.wasPressedThisFrame)
{
    move = speed * Time.deltaTime;
    transform.Translate(move,0.0f,0.0f);
}
if (keyboard.current.skey.wasPressedThisFrame)
{
    move = -speed * Time.deltaTime;
    transform.Translate(move,0.0f,0.0f);
}
.
.
.

{% endhighlight %}

You get this idea, long winded and rather time consuming.

I was aware of vector usage from my days of using Processing, P5.js which [The Coding Train][code-train] does a load of youtube stuff on, very interesting if you want to learn about JS and make it arty. very beginner friendly.

Anyway back to the project.

Interestingly I didn't think the

{% highlight csharp %}
    transform.Translate(movement);
{% endhighlight %}

was going to work as it's a Vector2 and Translate when you hover over it, it gives you a tool tip asking for a Vector3.

My game is 2D, not 3D whats the point adding in a Z axis at this point in time.

Okay the part I wasted my time on, I'm kicking myself because of this.

When you use [SerializeField] basically you are then making a private field visible and editable in the Unity Inspector.
Rather than type in by hand, you can just add it directly from the editor. It's a serious game changer (although i've never really made games before).

However one thing I forgot to realise that when you setup a SerializedField. you can add a value in the script directly as you can see in the mover class

{% highlight csharp %}
    [SerializeField] float speed = 10.0f;
{% endhighlight %}

which gives me my movement speed variable.
BUT initially when I set it up. I had it set to 0.0f.
So when it loaded properly onto the Unity Inspector. As you may guess it, it's set to 0. Which as it turns out, overides what you've written directly in the script.
So for AN HOUR. I could not wrap my head around why the output values of when I was clicking forward key why it was returning 0. I thought maybe I was using vectors wrong and you couldn't multiple them by a float.
I thought I had missed a step and forgot to add in a different variable to control it. I thought I had to make a new vector instance and add the InputAction into a new vector and manipulate it there.
No matter what I did it always returned 0.
Eventually I gave up and went away and played some League of Legends like a degenerate. But I came back with fury. Realistically at this point I should have just stopped and closed the Project and then recorded it from there. But I didn't, I continued on.

Once I figured out what the problem was the code worked like a charm.
The next thing was to get the coins in the world.

{% highlight csharp %}
using UnityEngine;

public class generator : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] GameObject coin;
    void Start()
    {
        coinGenerate();
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {

    }

    void coinGenerate()
    {
        for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            float randX = Random.Range(-8f, 8.7f);
            float randY = Random.Range(-4f, 4.7f);
            Object.Instantiate(coin, new Vector2(randX, randY), Quaternion.identity);
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

When I initially added this script. I added it onto the coin...
Before continuing to read on guess what happened.
.
.
.
.

If you guess that it caused a recursion, you are absolutely correct.
Everytime a coin was Instantiated the script ran again and again. I couldn't stop it. ctrl+shift+esc - end tasked that bad boy.

Realising I needed to put it onto something else I just slapped it onto the player, the player will always be there.
No harm no foul.

Now that was out the way. I needed to figure out how the player will pick up the coins, and how the player will 'Win' the game. 

Being able to collect the coins was simple enough:

{% highlight csharp %}
using UnityEngine;

public class collect : MonoBehaviour
{
    
    void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D other)
    {
        Debug.Log(other.gameObject.tag);
        if (other.gameObject.tag == "Player")
        {
            Destroy(gameObject);
        }   
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Okay OnTriggerEnter2D. you need to add a component first:
![image](/assets/images/blog_2/Screenshot 2025-05-25 213603.png)

'Is Trigger' ticked.
and you are good to go.

But wait, how does it know that I have won? I guess once the coins are gone it's a win?
Yeah, nah, let's be a bit more flashy.

after Destroy(gameObject);

added a new line of code

{% highlight csharp %}
    scoreScript.scorevalue += 1;
{% endhighlight %}

oh I learnt how to make a variable public so I can edit it in another script.

The score script as follows:

{% highlight csharp %}
using TMPro;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.InputSystem;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;


public class scoreScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static int scorevalue = 0;

    [SerializeField] TMP_Text score1;
    [SerializeField] GameObject youWin;
    [SerializeField] InputAction quit;

    void Awake()
    {
        youWin.SetActive(false);
    }

    void Update()
    {
        score1.text = "score : " + scorevalue;
        if (scorevalue == 10)
        {
            youWin.SetActive(true);
        }

        if (Keyboard.current.lKey.wasPressedThisFrame)
        {
            youWin.SetActive(false);
            scorevalue = 0;
            SceneManager.LoadScene(SceneManager.GetActiveScene().name);
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

okay there is a bit in here, because I can't be bothered to edit it to show my full progress.

But the public variable is here, the collect script adds to this variable.
Which I can then use to keep track of the number of coins collected.

In the Update method I have an if statement that checks to see if it has reached 10. and similar to my first project. Throws up a You Win text screen.

also added a reset button. basically press L to close the win text and reset the score also reloads the scene to generate 10 new coins.

Turns out when you refresh the screne it does not run the Awake Method. which I thought was interesting to know.

Areas of Improvement:

Well I was having issues once again with the scaliing of the game. The camera is pre-set to a size. But when you set the aspect ratio to freely move based on your game window size, it gets a bit weird and I don't know how to fix an aspect ratio or even what ever aspect ratio you are using it fits to that size.

I was able to do that for the UI scaling in project 1 because I saw an option for it.

But in this project I didn't know what to do yet. As I added in objects into the world. How do you scale them to a screen size? what if this was on a phone screen instead?
It would throw everything off and look bizarre.

for example:

{% highlight csharp %}
    float randX = Random.Range(-8f, 8.7f);
    float randY = Random.Range(-4f, 4.7f);
{% endhighlight %}

This is the area of where the coins would generate as you can see I have fixed numbers in place because I manaully looked roughly at each corner on the 16:9 aspect ratio and just punched those numbers in.
Realising this ideally I would have to figure out where I can find the X,Y coordinates of each corner of the camera in the camera object at the ratio size that the screen is currently in, that way ANY aspect will work and use those variables in the code instead (give or take some space so they aren't being generated in the corners).


Well that's enough for today. This one pooped me but I had fun and the satisfaction of completing it was something else entirely.

Here it is:
[Coin Collector][coin-collector]

FYI: Sorry it only works in Aspect Ratio 16:9, it will need to be fullscreened.
