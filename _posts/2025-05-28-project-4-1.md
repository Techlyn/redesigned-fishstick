This is going to be a little different.

I decided to make a bunch of small projects into a slightly bigger project.

So I'm going to break this one up into smaller chunks rather than making it in a short time frame - which is doable. 
But once I had started this I couldn't stop.


So a lot of people have seen Text Based adventure games they kinda look like this:

FYI Portcullis can be found [here][portcullis]

You have a few type in options and it describes the environment and you continue on. Any gaming nut would know about these.

What I wanted to do was not necessisarily an adventure style game like you can see in the example but more of a slice-of-life style text game.

Where you have a mobile phone interface and you talk to your friends/family/work colleagues - (whoever I haven't actually thought of plot yet).

I have just been building the framework - hence the reason why I've started smaller projects to make one over all project.

So yesterday and today I have been having a crack at it and i've made some decent headway to get everything in place ready to make an actual story.

So far this is what it looks like:

It don't look like much, well that's because it isn't - yet.

The main bits i've added so far is a way to generate texts and a way to scroll through messages.

Which I'll through now.

These were challenges in themselves.

I wasn't sure how to go about designing a lot of these things, so there is a mixture of UI Objects as well as Sprite Objects.

All UI based objects are located on the screen and all Sprite Objects are located to make it look like a phone.

The main part is this stuff that I was working on is this stuff:

![image](/assets/images/blog_4/Screenshot 2025-05-28 201310.png)

UI Objects have to work in a canvas, there are two canvas - I don't know why I did two but I did so there.

You don't need two, in this instance one is fine as it's all in the same space.

The TextInputCanvas just displays the text box that you can type in 
The Message Screen Canvas displays the actual messages and also the background.
The Text Input Field is straight forward to work however I have discovered that if you write more in it that the space is provided. It does go outside the textbox space.

![image](/assets/images/blog_4/Screenshot 2025-05-28 202209.png)

But the sake of testing it works fine.

I think when I make it into a game, there will be multiple choice options instead of typing it. I'm not sure yet.


Setting up the messages to go up like they do on whatapp or facebook messager was a challenge in itself.

I had discovered something called Vertical Layout Group which basically locks objects into a vertical line.
Where you can adjust the spacings, padding and everything so it looks the same,

The problems that I had with it was that when you generate a new speachbubble it would scale in both directions to fit the text. so it was going off screen a lot.

The other issue I was having was that when I added a new bubble it would either try and fit it in the space I gave it cramming all the messages together till there were too many and it would overflow.

Or it would add them bollow and the messages would go down offscreen and the old message would not budge upwards.

To fix this, I rotated everything upside down, span the Reply messages 180 so they were right way round as well the send messages the right way round.
Tweaked it to make it look pretty and surprisingly it worked.

Intially I tried creating a script to add the size of the speakbubble to the height, but because the height was locked, it could not be adjusted.

{% highlight csharp %}

using TMPro;
using UnityEngine;

public class SendText : MonoBehaviour
{

    [SerializeField] TMP_Text input;
    [SerializeField] GameObject sendMessage;
    [SerializeField] Transform parent;

    // [SerializeField] RectTransform par;
    // [SerializeField] UnityEngine.Vector2 sizeChange = new UnityEngine.Vector2(0f, 0f);

    // float sizeIncrease = 0.01450192f;


    void OnMouseDown()
    {
        SendMessage(input.text);
    }

    new void SendMessage(string text)
    {
        
        GameObject send = Instantiate(sendMessage, parent);
        send.SetActive(true);
        // sizeChange.Set(0.0f,send.GetComponent<RectTransform>().sizeDelta.y * sizeIncrease);
        // par.sizeDelta += sizeChange;
        send.GetComponentInChildren<TMP_Text>().text = text;
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

To be honest a lot of this is stuff I've done before in previous projects. so there is no need to go over it.

The commented out stuff was me trying to expand the space in which texts can occupy causing them to go up and off the screen giving the illusion of a real text messaging app.
It wasn't necessary in the end.

The GameObject that sends messages is the button with the play icon on it, had to make sure there was a collision on it for the mouse to trigger it.
I gave it a visual with another script:

{% highlight csharp %}

    [SerializeField] GameObject OuterCircle;

    [SerializeField] Material greenMaterial;
    [SerializeField] Material blueMaterial;
    
    void OnMouseOver()
    {
        OuterCircle.GetComponent<Renderer>().material = blueMaterial;
        
    }

    void OnMouseExit()
    {
        OuterCircle.GetComponent<Renderer>().material = greenMaterial;
        
    }
{% endhighlight %}

Which just turns the outer green circle blue when hovering it, and turns it back to the green when not hovering it.

Oh boy the scrollbar.

This took a lot of trial and error:


{% highlight csharp %}
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class Scroll : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] VerticalLayoutGroup vl;
    [SerializeField] float adjustmentValue = 0.0f;

    Vector2 mousePos2 = new Vector2(0f, 0f);
    Vector2 upperLimit = new Vector2(2.5f, 4.35f);
    Vector2 lowerLimit = new Vector2(2.5f, -2.55f);

    float messageStartLocation;
    float messageEndLocation;
    float scrollBarStartLocation;
    float scrollBarEndLocation;
    

    bool isLocked = true;

    void Start()
    {
        messageStartLocation = 0.0f;
        scrollBarStartLocation = -2.55f;
        scrollBarEndLocation = 4.35f;
    }

    void Update()
    {
        messageEndLocation = vl.GetComponent<RectTransform>().sizeDelta.y - adjustmentValue;

        moveScrollBar();
        float smValue = ScrollMessageValue();
        moveVerticalLayout(smValue);

    }

    void OnMouseDown()
    {
        isLocked = false;
    }

    void OnMouseUp()
    {
        isLocked = true;
    }

    void moveScrollBar()
    {
        Vector2 mousePos = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(Input.mousePosition);
        mousePos = new Vector2(0.0f, mousePos.y);
        if (!isLocked)
        {
            if (lowerLimit.y >= mousePos.y)
            {
                transform.SetPositionAndRotation(lowerLimit, Quaternion.identity);
            }
            else if (mousePos.y >= upperLimit.y)
            {
                transform.SetPositionAndRotation(upperLimit, Quaternion.identity);
            }
            else
            {
                if (mousePos2 != new Vector2(0f, 0f))
                {
                    transform.Translate(mousePos - mousePos2);
                    mousePos2 = mousePos;
                }
            }
        }
        mousePos2 = mousePos;
    }

    float CollectScrollBarPos()
    {
        return transform.position.y;
    }

    float Map(float from, float to, float from2, float to2, float value)
    {
        if (value <= from2)
        {
            return from;
        }
        else if (value >= to2)
        {
            return to;
        }
        else
        {
            return (to - from) * ((value - from2) / (to2 - from2)) + from;
        }
    }

    float ScrollMessageValue()
    {
        float scrollBarPos = CollectScrollBarPos();

        return Map(messageStartLocation, messageEndLocation, scrollBarStartLocation, scrollBarEndLocation, scrollBarPos);

    }

    void moveVerticalLayout(float smValue)
    {
        Vector2 newPos = new Vector2(vl.GetComponent<RectTransform>().position.x, -smValue - 2.9f);
        RectTransform trans = vl.GetComponent<RectTransform>();
        Debug.Log(trans.position);
        
        trans.SetPositionAndRotation(newPos, vl.GetComponent<RectTransform>().rotation);
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}

The trusty Map method made a return! I had to use it, really useful method for what I was trying to do.

So in order to get the scrollbar to actaully interact with the mouse click 

{% highlight %}

void moveScrollBar()
    {
        Vector2 mousePos = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(Input.mousePosition);
        mousePos = new Vector2(0.0f, mousePos.y);
        if (!isLocked)
        {
            if (lowerLimit.y >= mousePos.y)
            {
                transform.SetPositionAndRotation(lowerLimit, Quaternion.identity);
            }
            else if (mousePos.y >= upperLimit.y)
            {
                transform.SetPositionAndRotation(upperLimit, Quaternion.identity);
            }
            else
            {
                if (mousePos2 != new Vector2(0f, 0f))
                {
                    transform.Translate(mousePos - mousePos2);
                    mousePos2 = mousePos;
                }
            }
        }
        mousePos2 = mousePos;
    }
{% end highlight %}

When your mouse is on the screen it is given it's own coordinates, initially I was getting the raw coordinates and it was messing everything up till I discovered you can get the coordinates based on the camera,
I only needed to Y axis so I had to change mousePos to have 0 coordinates on the X axis.

the isLocked makes a return to stop it from moving around when it's not clicked on.

the limits in place so the bar doesn't disappear off the screen I had to fix the y position so say that you move the scroll bar up to 20 on the y axis but then you keep moving the mouse up to say 40 or 50 on the y axis, the scrollbar will not go any higher, did that for both directions.

Then the movement itself.

When you call the Update method, it is activated a tick at a time or 1 frame at a time. So for the first frame there wouldn't be a value albiet a frame is very quick if someone could click on the scrollbar within that first frame i'd be impressed but i still added it in:

{% highlight csharp %}
if (mousePos2 != new Vector(0f, 0f))
{% endhighlight %}

I'll try and explain how it moves to the best of my ability.
Lets slow down time, lets say 1 frame happens every 10 seconds.

So the first frame you click on the scrollbar you have now given mousePos a value. but mousePos2 has no value so it will ignore moving the scrollbar and put the value in mousePos2 and start again.
The second frame, you decide to move the scroll bar up some say half way. mousePos will get a new Y value. but mousePos2 will contain the previous frames value.
When the transform.Translate() method is called it needs to know how far it will move it so you subtract the two y values from each other giving you the distance between Position A and Position B.

Although after typing this up I realise I could have just bound the Y axis of the mouse to the scrollbar by doing

{% highlight csharp %}
transform.position = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(Input.mousePosition)
{% endhighlight %}

which would probably tidy this up quite nicely. Not sure haven't tested it.


The rest of the method is used to get the information required in order to actually scroll the messages up and down which is where the Map method comes into play.
Similar to how it was used in Project 3 to make the rain fall faster as time went on,

I used it slightly differently. So that when the scrollbar was at the bottom it would display the most latest messages and if it was at the top it would display the oldest messages.


The issue I had was if you look in the start function you can see a bunch of fixed floats. These do not change at all. The one that does change however is the messageEndLocation which scales up with the number of messages that have been sent and received.

You can visually see the end here:

This value here was what I needed but you can't find it in the the normal Transform component that you'll find on your normal objects.
No no no, it was in Rect Transform.

so when you call for it in start

with
{% highlight csharp %}
vl.GetComponent<RectTransform>().sizeDelta.y
{% end highlight %}

Originally I just wanted to get the initial value of it and I was trying for sooo long looking for a way to find the value.

everytime I ran a debug on it, the value kept returning 0 I could not figure out why it was returning 0.

I tried finding the variable for it with different Components, I added in new components to see if it would even display it there. But nothing.

Eventually I found a post talking about how it doesn't update straight away. So instead I ran it through the Update method and it returned a value!
Finally I got this working.

Afterwards I had to do some tweaking to get it to line up and then finally give it a proper test:

![gif](/assets/gifs/blog_4/ScrollExample.gif)


It works, it does what I want it to do.

There is still a long way to go for this little project.
But now that I have this setup the foundations are looking strong.


The things that need to be added:

    1. An Inbox, as a normal person has usually more than 1 friend/family member
    2. A way to switch between Inbox and messages to an individual
    4. To have a "person" sending texts to the player to interact with.
    5. To change the text input to a multiple choice input.
    6. Get the Back button to get to the inbox to work and the menu button on the right to do something.
    7. Then finally the actaul story.


As I was writing this up I have came up with a story idea which would suit this nicely.
I don't want to give too much away because I do want to get people to play test it once it is done and see what they think about it.

This does deviate from what I was initially trying to accomplish. The goal was to create 100 Games, 1 game a day in a short time frame.

However I have split this game up into smaller projects and that has changed my outlook on this challenge entirely.
