Today is day zero.

I have created a new website using Jekyll, bought a domain name to put it on and now it's to make a start in the this little project,

Althrough the website is basic for now, it'll do for now and over time as I learn I will append to it and make it something worth sharing,
but for now it'll just be a collection of thoughts.

This begain because I was stuck. I constantly watch tutorials on different development of games, read a bunch of articles, even downloaded 
some engines to play around with.

I have a concepts for games, yet they are always far beyond my reach and I get stuck trying to think of where to begin.

I watched a youtube video by [Luc Forsyth][yt-vid-lazy] which basically goes over Creativity but you're lazy and he talks about his experience.
Although in his context is slightly different the principles are still the same.
The part that stood out to me was the anecdote about making pottery. Which starts at around [9:50][yt-vid-lazy-snip].

Where he mentions a case study in the book Atomic Habits, which 2 groups are tasked with making a pot, one group makes one pot and tries to pefect it.
The second group makes multiple pots like 50 - 100 pots and do them in a fairly quick succession, the point made is that the group making pots in 
quick succession although the pots are at first generally bad, over time there is an improvement which a person can see. Progress!

As for what I did with these thoughts in my mind I decided to give this a go, but I'm terrible at putting together some sort of plan,
so instead I turned to chatGPT and asked it:


To break free from tutorial paralysis and build real game development skills, embrace the "quantity over quality" approach by creating many small, quick projects. Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Start Microscopically
    * Ultra-Simple Games First: Begin with projects you can finish in 1-2 hours. Examples:

        * Clicker Game: Click a button to increment a counter.

        * Avoid the Falling Blocks: Move a square with arrow keys to dodge obstacles.

        * One-Button Jumper: Press spacebar to make a cube jump over a pit.

2. Use Constraints to Force Creativity

    * Time Limits: Give yourself 2 hours per project. Use a timer.

    * Asset Restrictions: Use basic shapes (circles, squares) or free placeholder art from sites like Kenney.nl.

    * Mechanic-of-the-Day: Focus on one core mechanic per project (e.g., movement, shooting, collecting).

3. Modify Tutorials, Don’t Just Follow Them

    * Tweak Tutorial Projects: After finishing a tutorial, add one small feature:

        * Add a high score system to a "Flappy Bird" clone.

        * Change the art style of a platformer tutorial.

        * Add a new power-up to a simple shooter.

4. Build a "Game Mechanics" Portfolio
    Create a list of 50 tiny mechanics to implement. Examples:

    1. Player movement (top-down, platformer, grid-based).

    2. Simple AI (enemies that follow the player).

    3. Collectibles with UI counters.

    4. A pause menu.

    5. A dialogue box system.
    Check them off as you go—seeing progress is motivating.

5. Adopt a "No Polish" Rule
    * Embrace Jank: Let your games be ugly and buggy. Your goal is to finish, not polish.

    * No Redos: Once a project is "done," move to the next. Revisit old projects only after 10 new ones.

6. Use the Simplest Tools
    * Engines: Stick to one engine for consistency (e.g., Godot for 2D, Unity for 3D).

    * Templates: Use pre-built project templates to skip boilerplate setup.

    * Code Snippets: Save reusable code (e.g., movement scripts) for future projects.

7. Track and Celebrate Progress
    * Log Your Projects: Keep a spreadsheet or journal with:

        * Project # | Title | Time Spent | What I Learned

    * Share Publicly: Post screenshots on Twitter or a blog, even if it’s just a green square on a black background.

8. Join Mini Game Jams

    * Participate in short jams like:

        * Ludum Dare 48 (weekend-long).

        * Weekly "1-Hour Game" challenge (self-imposed).

    * Constraints breed creativity, and deadlines force action.

9. Iterate, Don’t Perfect

    Example progression:

        * Project 1: A red square moves left/right.

        * Project 2: The square jumps when you press space.

        * Project 3: The square collects yellow circles.

        * Project 10: Combine all three into a basic platformer.

10. Embrace the "Fail Faster" Mindset

    * Expect Bugs: Debugging is part of the process. When stuck, ask:

        * "What’s the smallest change I can make to test this?"

    * Learn by Breaking Things: Intentionally break a tutorial project, then fix it.

First 5 Project Ideas to Start Today

    1. "Press SPACE to Win": A game where pressing the spacebar once displays "You Win!"

    2. "Coin Collector": Move a cube to touch 10 coins (yellow circles) scattered randomly.

    3. "Dodge the Rain": Avoid falling raindrops with arrow keys.

    4. "Text Adventure": A 3-choice story in the console (e.g., "You find a key. Take it? [Y/N]").

    5. "Endless Runner": A cube auto-moves forward; press jump to avoid a single obstacle.

By the time you finish 10 of these, you’ll have tackled movement, UI, collision, and basic design—far more valuable than months of tutorials. Start small, ship often, and let momentum beat perfectionism.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
However I didn't start today.

I have started the following day instead, as it took all my energy getting this website up. (I guess this is also a start)

My idea is simple, I have been given a small project list.
As I get closer to end of the list, I will generate a new list either by checking through the games that I have played thus far,
looking up online for tasks.
Each project will have distinct and simple goal, after a few projects, maybe combine some of them?
Like for example on the project ideas number 3 "Dodge the Rain" make an iteration of it where you dodge the rain, but collect coins like in project 2's "Coin Collector?

It's a start, it's a bit daunting at first, but that is why I started this blog in the first place.
A place I can reflect and look back on, and maybe one day share with others who are stuck in similar ruts.

The first post is probably going to be this detailed, but as the projects flow the information will be limited as my blog making skills are not very good.
But it's a start! 

So lets begin.
