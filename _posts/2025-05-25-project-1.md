Here we are the first project,

Was a fairly quick project but that is okay. There were a couple of challenges that I will address shortly.

This project was a success, I should have recorded the time but I believe roughly 20 minutes. (remember to record the time next project) infact I think it will take me longer writing this blog post than completing this task.

Anyways, to begin with I want to address that I am making 2D Games (if they are called games, I mean they have a win condition so I guess they are!).

The engine I am using is Unity, as C# is my most familiar language and I am comfortable using the GUI that Unity provides. I had a look a Godot but it just felt clunky? The Text editor I am using is Visual Studio Code.

That being said,

I made a new project on Unity.
Left it as defaultly created.

Added in text using UI object:

![image](/assets/images/blog_1/Screenshot 2025-05-24 140718.png){:width="333px" height="484px"}

Starting in the Hierachy tab:
 
    Right click blank space -> UI -> TextMeshPro

I had to import TextMeshPro but it asked me to do so when I clicked it.
Just did this twice to create two text pieces.

Centered them into my Default Camera screen on the by clicking on Canvas in the hierarchy.
There is a component on the right hand side that can keep the text that scales with the screen size.
When I first added text it was half in the camera window and half out. which is no good.

Then came the script

{% highlight csharp %}

using UnityEngine;

public class wonscript : MonoBehaviour
{

    [SerializeField] GameObject startText;
    [SerializeField] GameObject endText;

    void Awake()
    {
        startText.SetActive(true);
        endText.SetActive(false);
    }

    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetButton("Jump"))
        {
            DestroyText();
            GenerateText();
        }
    }

    void DestroyText()
    {
        startText.SetActive(false);
    }

    void GenerateText()
    {
        endText.SetActive(true);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Which I dragged and dropped onto Canvas on the Heirarchy afterwards I need to put the texts that I made into the Serialized Fields that I assigned on the script

When I first ran it through I got my first error,

![image](/assets/images/blog_1/Screenshot 2025-05-24 141018.png)

which directed me where to go to correct it. At first when I added the

{% highlight csharp %}

    if (Input.GetButton("Jump"))
    {
        DestroyText();
        GenerateText();
    }

{% endhighlight %}

I actually had it setup as

{% highlight csharp %}
    if (Input.GetButton("Space"))
{% endhighlight %}

Which as you can see from the error doesn't exist.

That was when I discovered it was under 'Jump' instead.

after correcting that.

I ran the program and it worked!

After twiddling around, I realise I could do it slightly differently.

As this was completed in 1 Scene

Instead I could have made two seperate scenes and then press space to jump to the next Scene. But if say there was a game behind the text, jumping to a different scene in a sense is jumping to a new 'level'.

The fact that I was using UI text, makes me think I could make a flashy UI with this in the future, but I don't want to think too much on it, I'll be getting ahead of myself otherwise.

That's enough from me today.
